To compile a version of the DirectXShaderCompiler library for use in C#, the library must be compiled from source

To do that, perform the following:

Copy git repo:
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler.git

Go into source (cloned) repo directory
cd <source-dir>

Copy subrepos:
git submodule update --init --recursive

Create a build directory next to the source repo directory. It cannot be contained inside the source repository.
mkdir <build-dir>

Travel to the build directory:
cd <build-dir>

Change the contents of the file located at <source-dir>/tools/clang/tools/dxcompiler/dxcapi.cpp to be the same as DXChanges/dxcapi.cpp

Run the cmake build command inside the build directory, linking the source directory cmake file:
cmake -C <source-dir>/cmake/caches/PredefinedParams.cmake <source-dir> -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_SPIRV_CODEGEN=ON

Then run ninja from inside the build directory:
ninja -j<thread-count>

Grab the dynamic library in <build-dir>/lib/ (lib)dxcompiler(.so/.dll/.dylib) and put it somewhere C# can load it.
